# Junior frontend developer based in Gothenburg, Sweden.

I just finished studying at Medieinstitutet here and am looking for work. Most of my experience so far is with Next.js and Sanity. Also taking freelance work!

Currently learning three.js and React Three Fiber, would like to expand into some fullstack tools/languages in the near future ðŸ”®

[See my website and some projects I worked on during my recent internship at Hoy Multimedia.](https://www.sublimesystems.eu/)

(If you're wondering why my git graph is so empty, it's because Hoy uses Bitbucket)
